# SP23-Virtual-Reality-Code-Learning
About The Project

Introduction of technology has always changed education. Blackboards, whiteboards, overhead projectors, PowerPoint, and countless other advancements in educational tools have paved the road to the learning structures we use today. Computer science has, and will, continue to harness the forefront of technology to provide the best and most efficient teaching methods possible. One of these emerging techniques uses gamification of learning. As opposed to using a to-do list of tasks to be completed in order to satisfy a curriculum, studies have been conducted harnessing virtual reality environments. By creating fun, engaging material in virtual reality, the complexity of learning to code is reduced, interest and motivation are increased, and graduation rates in courses are boosted \citep{gradRate}. This project seeks to compare the benefits of virtual reality learning to that of a more traditional learning environment operating in the computer science field. Measuring any potential benefits and finding ways to apply them to teaching specifically at the collegiate level in relation to computer science could lead to future improvements in technology and result in more enthusiastic, proficient programmers entering the field.



Built With
Unreal Engine 5 

Getting Started
Once you have sdk and jdk packages set up on your local machine, run install for your headset. Upon launching the program, the user needs to only sit, look, and listen to the instructions given.


Prerequisites
JDK 1.8.0_77 (jdk-8u77-windows-x64.exe)
SDK 23.0.3//25.0.3//29.0.2//30.0.3//31.0.0//32.0.0
NDK 21.3.6528147

To accomplish the above, follow instructions here https://www.codeprofessionally.com/unreal-engine-packaging-for-android-to-any-unrealengine-version/ 

Installation
After wrapping the project successfully, open the folder you created. Find and double click “Install_vrcl.bat”
If the installation is successful, the window will automatically disappear.
Wear the Headset, press the home button on the controller and go back to the main menu. 
Open the “App Library”, Click the “All” drop box on the top right. Click the “Unknow Sources”. Find the project name.

Usage
The project is designed to be used by a user in a static environment.
